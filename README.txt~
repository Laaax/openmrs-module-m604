openmrs-module-m604
===================

Guidelines to test the functionality of the code

1)Download the package openmrs-standalone-1.8.2-with-demo-data from http://en.flossmanuals.net/openmrs-guide/installation-and-initial-setup/
   and follow the setup procedure as described.
2) Navigate to the folder where the directory has been placed and run the program.
3)Open a web browser and enter in the URL   http:localhost:8081/openmrs-standalone
4)A login page should open up. Login witht the details
		Username : admin
		Password : Admin123
5)Go to the "Administration" section by clickin on the "Administration" tab.
6)Go to "Manage Module" section. 
7) Clone the git package from    https://github.com/ykolesn/openmrs-module-m604.git      to your local machine.
8)Run the cloned git package as a maven project
	nonte that both steps 7 and 8 are easier to perform using Eclipse
9)The maven build will generate a changerelationship.omod file in the  openmrs-module-m604/changerelationship/omod/target folder.
10)On the "Manage module " page upload the .omod file using the "Add module" function
11)Once uploaded go back to the administration page and refresh. You must be able to see a "Change relationship" link. Clicking on the link will take you to the page of 		our module. 


User guide.
1)To test the code some sample data is needed. Some sample data is generated and deleted by the code automatically.
2)However, to test the code you may want to generate data on your own. In that case please follow thefollowing steps
	i)  Open the file  openmrs-module-m604/changerelationship/api/src/main/java/org.openmrs.data/SampleData.java
	    In this class create new people using the same format as the one used from line 76t o 81 in the createPersons() function
	ii) Similarly create new realtionships(line 62-66 in the function createNewRelationships) in the introduceRelationships() function
		To create new relationships, you do not need to create new relationship types as there are already 4 different relationshiptypes.
		In case you wish to add relationship types of your own, please do so using the "Manage Relationship Types" link on the Adminsitration page and change the 			source code in the SmapleData.java file correspondingly.
5)Once the data   is input you are free to test the code to change relationships of different people using the web UI.
6) The first text box takes the name of the person who already is related to several people. The drop down menu allows the user to select the relationship of the person 	that has to be changed
7)The second text box takes the name of the person against whom new relations need to be created. The drop down menu allows the user to select the relationship of the person 	to which it has to be changed.
8)Press "Change", to update the records. A notification about the success status of the update will be displayed.
